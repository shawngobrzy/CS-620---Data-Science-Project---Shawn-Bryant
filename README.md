# Abstract
Diabetes is a common disease that has increased by almost 20% from 2012 to 2022. It is a chronic disease that prevents the body from producing insulin or using it properly and causes abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates and can lead to more serious health problems such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease. Because of the exponential rise of Diabetes, and lack of a cure, stopping the increase of diabetes cases has become a main priority in modern day health science. Obesity, lack of physical activity, and genetics are some of the documented leading causes of diabetes. However, one factor continues to fall under the radar year after year and that is sleep. Rest is siginicant factor to the cause of diabetes because poor sleep quality can and will affect glucose levels, raise insulin resistance and change hormone levels, making it difficult for insulin to balance blood sugar, and release ghrelin, which is a hunger promoting hormone. Given the difference in daily activities between adults and children, children typically receive more sleep than adults. Therefore, the glucose levels may vary between these demographics.

**End Goal**

*   I will be investigating the relationship between adult's and childrenâ€™s sleep activity and glucose levels by analyzing comprehensive health and demographic data to reveal patterns that will potentially introduce early interventions or personalized treatments for managing glucose levels in pediatric and adult populations alike.
